    "# 2. Part Two: Using numpy arrays' operations and image manipulation (application):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To begin, let us load the image into numpy. This can be done by using the imread() function from the matplotlib library. This function allows numpy to read graphic files with different extensions. The output is a two-dimensional array with the dimensions equal to the dimensions of the image, and the values corresponding to the colors of the pixels.\n",
    "    Here we will work with a grayscale image, so the elements in the array will be integers ranging from 0 to 255 in the numpy integer format uint8. Type in the following code to load the file “fibonacci.jpg” into numpy:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
    "    ImJPG = plt.imread('fibonacci.jpg')\n",
    "    #you can get the image from the link https://ydjemmada.github.io/fibonacci.jpg\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The array ImJPG is a two-dimensional array of the type uint8 which contains values from 0 to 255 corresponding to the color of each individual pixel in the image, where 0 corresponds to black and 255 to white. You can visualize this array by printing it in the console:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(ImJPG) #prints the array values\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG,cmap='gray')#shows the image\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Use the shape attribute to check the dimensions of the obtained array ImJPG:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    m, n = ImJPG.shape\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    1. What are the dimensions of the image?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the type of the array ImJPG by using the dtype attribute: ImJPG.dtype The output of the dtype attribute is a numpy data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Find the range of colors in the image by using the amin and amax functions and save those elements as maxImJPG and minImJPG:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    maxImJPG = np.amax(ImJPG)\n",
    "    minImJPG = np.amin(ImJPG)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, display the image on the screen by using imshow: \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    If you did everything correctly, you should see the image displayed on your screen in a separate window.\n",
    "6. To crop the image in numpy, we can select a subarray from the original array `ImJPG`. The rows and columns we want to keep from the original array can be specified using indexing. The following code will select the central part of the image leaving out 100 pixels from the top and bottom, and 100 pixels on the left and 70 pixels on the right, and display the result using matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_center = ImJPG[100:m-100, 100:n-70]\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_center, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will create a new figure window displaying the cropped image.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We can paste the selected part of the image into another image. To do this, create a zero matrix using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_border = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=np.uint8)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then paste the preselected matrix ImJPG_center into matrix ImJPG_border and display the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_border[100:m-100, 100:n-70] = ImJPG_center\n",
    "    plt.figure()\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_border, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Notice the use of the data type np.uint8. It is necessary to use this data type because by default the array will be of the type float, and imshow command does not work correctly with this type of array.\n",
    "8. To flip the image vertically using NumPy, we can use the flipud function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_vertflip = np.flipud(ImJPG)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_vertflip, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will create a new array ImJPG_vertflip that is a vertically flipped version of the original array ImJPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. To transpose the matrix using NumPy, we can use the transpose attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_transpose = ImJPG.transpose()\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_transpose, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "10. To flip the image horizontally using NumPy, we can combine the transpose attribute and the fliplr function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_horflip = np.fliplr(ImJPG_transpose).transpose()\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_horflip, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "11. To rotate the image by 90 degrees using NumPy, we can use the rot90 function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG90 = np.rot90(ImJPG)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG90, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "12. Try running the following numpy commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_inv = 255-ImJPG\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_inv)\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Display the resulting image using matplotlib's imshow function in a new figure window. Note that the constant 255 is subtracted from the array ImJPG, which mathematically does not make sense. However, in numpy, the constant 255 is treated as an array of the same size as ImJPG with all the elements equal to 255. Explain what happened to the image.\n",
    "13. It is also easy to lighten or darken images using matrix addition. For instance, the following code will create a darker image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_dark=np.clip(np.array(ImJPG, dtype='int16') - 50, 0, 255)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_dark,cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    You can darken the image even more by changing the constant to a number larger than 50. Note that this command can technically make some of the elements of the array to become negative. However, because the ImJPG array type is int16, with the function clip those elements are automatically rounded to zero.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. Let us create Andy Warhol style art with the image provided. To do so we will arrange four copies of the image into a 2×2 matrix. For the top left corner we will take the unaltered image. For the top right corner we will darken the image by 50 shades of gray. For the bottom left corner, lighten the image by 100 shades of gray, and finally, for the bottom right corner, lighten the image by 50 shades of gray. Then we will arrange the images together in one larger matrix using numpy's concatenation function. Finally, display the resulting block matrix as a single image using matplotlib's imshow function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    im1 = ImJPG\n",
    "    im2 = np.clip(np.array(ImJPG, dtype='int16') - 50, 0, 255)\n",
    "    im3 = np.clip(np.array(ImJPG, dtype='int16') + 100, 0, 255)\n",
    "    im4 = np.clip(np.array(ImJPG, dtype='int16') + 50, 0, 255)\n",

    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_warhol,cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "15. Numpy has several functions which allow one to round any number to the nearest integer or a decimal fraction with a given number of digits after the decimal point. Those functions include: floor which rounds the number towards negative infinity (to the smaller value), ceil which rounds towards positive infinity (to the larger value), round which rounds towards the nearest decimal or integer, and fix which rounds towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A naive way to obtain black and white conversion of the image can be accomplished by making all the gray shades which are darker or equal to a medium gray (described by a value 128) to appear as a complete black, and all the shades of gray which are lighter than this medium gray to appear as white. This can be done, for instance, by using the code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    ImJPG_bw = np.uint8(255*np.floor(ImJPG/128))\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_bw, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",

    "    ImJPG_Gamma05 = np.clip(ImJPG** 0.95,0,255)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_Gamma05, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ImJPG_Gamma15 = np.clip(ImJPG ** 1.15,0,255)\n",
    "    plt.imshow(ImJPG_Gamma15, cmap='gray')\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Observe the results by displaying the images. The above code will produce two images, one with gamma equal to 0.95 (ImJPG_Gamma05) and one with gamma equal to 1.05 (ImJPG_Gamma15). Gamma correction is a nonlinear operation that can be used to adjust the brightness and contrast of an image."
