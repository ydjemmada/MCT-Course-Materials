    "4. Calculate the time it takes for the driver to travel on a specific path by adding the weights of the edges between the delivery sites and the restaurant. The path is $$A_{12} + A_{23} + A_{34} + A_{45} + A_{51}$$.\n",
    "5. Explore other paths by permuting the rows of the matrix **A**. Calculate how many permutations there are by using numpy's factorial function.\n",
    "6. Use numpy's permutation function to generate all permutations of the rows of matrix **A**. Store the permutations in a numpy array **P**.\n",
    "7. Loop through the rows of **P** and calculate the time it takes for the driver to travel on each path. \n",
