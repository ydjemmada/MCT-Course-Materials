    "this question lead us to publish a the following paper\n",
    "- Belbachir, H., Dj., Y. & NÃ©meth, L. (2022). \"The deranged Bell numbers\". Mathematica Slovaca (accepted).\n",
    "Motivated by this work, and the fact that ordered Bell numbers are the number of permutations of blocks, we tried to find another special permutation but this time why do not try link the historical Fibonacci and Lucas number to the set partition numbers, so a second joined work with Dr. Mehdaoui (NHSM) and  Professors Nemeth and Szalay (Sopron Univ.) we asked the question **What is the total number of the ordered partitions such that each block will be in his position or the position of one of his adjacent blocks (deranged blocks)**.\n",

    "- During my visit to the hosting university, the students were on vacation due to an energy crisis in the country, only PhD students were still working on their research projects during this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several meetings were taking place between staff members to identify areas for improvement and discuss potential solutions to the challenges faced by the department.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was clear that they were passionate about their research works.\n",

    "# New teaching method \n",
    "\n",
    "- During my visit to Sopron university, after a discussion with stuff members, there were two primary teaching methods utilized by the department of mathematics and computer sciences:\n",
    "    1. The first was the classical teaching method, which involved in-person lectures and traditional classroom instruction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. The second was the use of new technologies, such as online teaching software, to enhance the learning experience for students.\n",
