    "- Files can be text documents, spreadsheets, HTML files, Python modules, executable applications, images, or audio files.\n",

    "- Every file and folder in a file system has a name, but a name is not sufficient to locate a file efficiently. - - Instead, every file can be specified using a pathname.\n",

    "To write to a file in Python, you need to open the file in write mode using the built-in `open()` function with the `'w'` or `'wb'` mode depending on the file's content type. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('filename.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, world!')\n",

    "This code opens a file named `'filename.txt'` in write mode using the `'w'` mode. Then, it writes the string `'Hello, world!'` to the file using the `write()` method. Finally, the file is closed using the `close()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to write multiple lines to the file, you can use the newline character `'\\n'` to separate the lines, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('filename.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Line 1\\n')\n",
    "file.write('Line 2\\n')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will write two lines to the file, each on a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using the `'w'` mode will overwrite any existing content in the file. If you want to append to an existing file, you can use the `'a'` or `'ab'` mode instead of `'w'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also write many lines using `writelines(list_of_line)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line Endings\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the new line character is represented by the escape sequence `\\n` . However text ﬁle formats are platform dependent, and diﬀerent operating systems use a diﬀerent byte sequence to encode a new line:\n",
    "- MS Windows uses the `\\r\\n` 2-character sequence.\n",
    "- Linux/UNIX and Mac OS X use the `\\n` character.\n",
    "- Mac OS up to version 9 uses the `\\r` character.\n",
    "## 4. Closing files\n",
    "In Python, it is important to close files after you have finished using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This releases the resources that were used by the file, and ensures that any data that was buffered in memory is written to the file. To close a file, you can use the `close()` method of the file object.\n",

    "For example, if you opened a file using `open('example.txt', 'r')`, you can close it using `close()` method:\n",

    "# Introduction to Exceptions and Error Handling\n",
    "An exception is a signal that an error has occurred, and Python's built-in exception handling mechanism allows you to gracefully handle these errors and prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `try-except` Blocks to Handle Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the try and except statements to handle exceptions. The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "When the code inside the `try` block raises an exception (error), the interpreter jumps to the corresponding except block. The `ExceptionType` argument specifies the type of exception to catch.\n",
    "For example, to catch all exceptions, you can use the `Exception` base class:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    # code to handle the exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use a `try-except` block to handle a ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Are you serious! You can't divide by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block attempts to divide 1 by 0, which raises a ZeroDivisionError. The corresponding except block catches the error and prints an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Multiple Types of Exceptions\n",
    "You can also catch specific types of exceptions, such as TypeError or ValueError. To handle multiple types of exceptions, you can include multiple except blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except TypeError:\n",
    "    # code to handle a TypeError\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    # code to handle a ValueError\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here's an example of how to handle multiple types of exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = int(\"not a number\")\n",
    "except (TypeError, ValueError):\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Invalid input\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the try block attempts to convert the string `\"not a number\"` to an integer, which raises a `ValueError`. The corresponding except block catches both `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions and prints an error message.\n",
    "## Multiple `except` and `else` block\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to handling different types of exceptions, you can also use multiple `except` and `else` to further customize the behavior of your error handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using multiple except blocks, you can specify different exception types and handle each one differently. Here's an example:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    y = 10 / x\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Result is:\", y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Using `finally` Blocks\n",
    "In addition to the try and except statements, Python provides the finally statement to run code that should execute regardless of whether an exception is raised:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    # code to handle the exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # code that always runs, even if there was an exception\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use a finally block:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "file = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # write data to the file\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the try block writes data to a file, and the finally block ensures that the file is closed, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Raising Exceptions\n",
    "You can use the raise statement to raise an exception of a specified type, along with an optional error message:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "raise ExceptionType(\"Error message\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here's an example of how to raise a `ValueError`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x=int(input(\"Give a positive integer > 19\\n\")) \n",
    "    if (x<=19):\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input Value\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Please focus a little!\")\n",
    "    sys.exit(1)\n",
    "print(\"Continue !\")\n",
    "# rest of code\n",
